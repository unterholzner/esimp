# esimp - Easy Simple Informative Modern LaTeX Presentation

The majority of the available LaTeX Beamer themes are limited and often do not fulfill the personal requirements and preferences in terms of structure and style. If LaTeX is your choice to create and edit your personalised slides, a look into the inner working of theme design with Beamer is needed. For my thesis presentation I created my own theme matching my requirements:
* Small side margins
* Header includes frame title and logo
* Footer incorporates information on author, title, date and page number
* Personalised enumeration symbol for frame title and outline
* Personalised color scheme

For a comprehensive description of the Beamer package, its predefined themes, as well as the available methods used to edit or even create templates from scratch, please have a look at the Beamer user guide.
